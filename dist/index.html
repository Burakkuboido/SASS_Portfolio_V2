                        The war within task list was a personal project that I wanted to create for my own personal use for a game that I play. The purpose of it was to
                        use CRUD (Create, Read, Update and Delete) to form a task list with categories, sub categories and tasks. This would make it so I can input tasks that
                        would need doing on the game. I could check each task off one by one and a counter would illustrate how many of the tasks have been completed.
                        The site would use local storage to remember the tasks that I have added.
                        I decided to use SCSS to create this site for the sole purpose of learning a new style sheet.

                    <p>Better Days Play Therapy was a website I designed and developed for one of my Mothers' friends. We spoke on teams in regards to the designs they wanted
                        as well as any features they wanted implemented. I gave my opinion on the design elements at times but in the end, it was mostly following their guidelines.
                        This was my first time working for someone else.

                    <p>Contemporary Coatings is a redesign of my brother-in-law's website for his business. I wanted to see if I was able to recreate his website which was made by
                        a professional web developer. It pushed my limits to see if I am able to reproduce a professional website. The gallery was the challenging part, but I found it interesting.
                        I also added and changed a few extra elements of the website to see if I could make an improvement.
